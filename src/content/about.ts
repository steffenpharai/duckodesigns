      heading: "Our Story",
      content: "Ducko Designs was born from a simple need: keeping our own little ones warm and comfortable. As parents, we discovered that traditional coats can be challenging to use with car seat straps, and we wanted clothing that was both functional and beautiful. So we set out to create something better. Today, we offer a full range of custom toddler clothing & accessories—from car-seat friendly ponchos to cozy pajamas, booties, gloves, and more. Each piece is thoughtfully designed and handmade with care.",

      content: "Our car-seat friendly ponchos are designed so that car seat straps can go underneath, allowing for proper strap placement. This design feature addresses common concerns about bulky outerwear and car seat straps. We always recommend following your car seat manufacturer's instructions for proper installation and use. Beyond ponchos, we design all our clothing with comfort, durability, and style in mind.",
